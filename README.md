# TDMS-Data-Browser
A Python application that can visualize the data within TDMS files. Created as a project for a student-run research laboratory.

In addition, there are 4 Python packages that are required to run Browser_1.2.py. These are:
- nptdms
- numpy
- PyQt5
- pyqtgraph

Lastly, at runtime, the Python script will ask the user to input a tdms file. When this occurs, make sure
that ".tdms" is included at the end. For example, the sample TDMS file would be inputted as "Data1Data File2020.tdms"
