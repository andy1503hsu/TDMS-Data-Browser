[TREL](https://texasrocketlab.com/), a student-run research laboratory at UT, is currently competing to be the first collegiate rocket team to launch a liquid-propelled, single-stage rocket that reaches the Karman Line (100 kilometers). This rocket, currently in the design phase, is known as Halcyon. I am a member of the Test and Launch Operations (“TLO”) Team, specifically the TLO Hotfire subteam. This subteam is responsible for developing and testing an analog of the rocket engine that will eventually be on Halcyon.

To be successful, an analog of Halcyon’s engine requires a myriad of sensors and valves that feed a constant stream of information about the engine’s state during testing. Although LabVIEW (the software we use for designing and running tests) provides helpful graphs that show a sensor’s or valve’s output in real-time, it does not provide an interface for the data from multiple sensors and valves to be visualized in one combined graph. In addition, at the end of tests, LabVIEW stores the test’s data (from all sensors and valves) in a TDMS file, a file format which is difficult to open and use.

Although I had prior experience with dynamic visualization through Space Golf, the data browser challenged my programming and problem solving skills in completely different ways. Instead of developing algorithms related to physics and calculus, I was now developing code related to ease of use and customization. These included:

-	Detecting whether a sensor or valve read digital data (only 0s and 1s) or non-digital data, and then, depending on which type of data it was, plotting it on one of two y-axes. 
-	Detecting if the TDMS data was written as a string or a double. If the data was a string, then they would have to be converted to a double prior to plotting.
-	Allowing the user to customize a plot’s color, and whether actual data points were shown in the plot
-	Ensuring that customizations from the right hand side of the browser translated to revisions in the plot itself

Currently, I am working on the ability for a user to “pre-input” the specific sensors and valves they wish to see on the graph, so that they do not have to manually input this information every time the data browser is run. In addition, I am also working on a data analysis script that would run in conjunction with the data browser to inform the user of relevant characteristics of the test, such as the duration of valve openings and flow coefficients of orifices and venturis.

I found (and continue to find!) being able to harness my programming ability to help a collective group effort extremely rewarding. Although programming is a skill by its intrinsic nature, I believe that it is best harnessed when wielded as a useful tool for a team to strive towards its goal, especially when that goal is not directly related to programming itself. Unlike Space Golf, which did not have any “bigger” purpose than a school project, this data browser genuinely helps the Hotfire subteam and TREL’s development of Halcyon. And, in the future, I hope to continue developing similar programming scripts that are a means to a greater end.
